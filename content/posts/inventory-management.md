summary: Feeling like your vault is stuffed? Canâ€™t figure out what roll to keep?
---

## [Destiny Item Manager](https://app.destinyitemmanager/)

```
is:item
```

## [God Roll Finder](https://www.light.gg/god-roll/roll-appraiser/)

Compare your drops with 1) expert wisdom (same as DIM) and 2) community-selected perks.

## [Destiny Optimizer](https://destinyoptimizer.com/)

Find out what powerful and pinnacle drops you should be chasing.

## [Vault Cleaner](https://destinyrecipes.com/vault)

Figure out which weapon and armor rolls you should keep
and which you should shard.
It just locks/unlocks the results for you,
so you can dismantle the items yourself.

## D2 Checklist

Turns out, the armor that the vendors sell can actually be great!
I've ignored Zavala's armor rolls for _years_.
The _Armor Stat Deals_ section is a great way to find out
who is selling armor that you might be interested in.

## Today in Destiny

The [Eververse Calendar](https://www.todayindestiny.com/eververseCalendar) is
useful to find out what Tess will be selling for Silver and what she will be
selling for Bright Dust.

## Lost Sector Calendar

Two different formats for you to choose:

- [Visual](https://www.todayindestiny.com/ls_calendar)
- [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rWoyGWouGFismhk2BQzbeuV7PgoxzGRhxf2Kyi27kTo/edit#gid=0)
