summary: Feeling like your vault is stuffed? Canâ€™t figure out what roll to keep?
---
## [Destiny Item Manager]

```
is:item

# fill in with my go-to rolls
```


## [Vault Cleaner]

Figure out which weapon and armor rolls you should keep
and which you should shard.

Vault Cleaner just locks/unlocks the results for you,
so you can dismantle the items yourself.

I usually start here and then fine-tune the results with God Roll Finder.

## [God Roll Finder]

Compare your drops with 1) expert wisdom (same as DIM) and 2) community-selected perks.

## [D2 Gunsmith]

Craft your own god roll,
see how the perks and masterworking affect the stats,
and copy your wishlists into DIM.

## [D2 Checklist]

Turns out, the armor that the vendors sell can actually be great!
I've ignored Zavala's armor rolls for _years_.
The _Armor Stat Deals_ section is a great way to find out
who is selling armor that you might be interested in.

## Today in Destiny

The [Eververse Calendar] is useful to
find out what Tess will be selling for Silver
and what she will be selling for Bright Dust.

## Lost Sector Calendar

Two different formats for you to choose:

-   [Visual][lost-sector-visual]
-   [Spreadsheet][lost-sector-spreadsheet]
